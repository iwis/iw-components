A timeline component based on:
 - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp and
 - "Knowledge Timeline" lesson made by Brad Traversy: https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/13285592

CSS classes:
  iw-timeline
      [iw-timeline--style-{w3schools|brad}] - colors of a timeline
      [iw-timeline--compact]                - a timeline is lower on wide screens
    iw-timeline__item
      iw-timeline__box

Default values of parameters can be changed also in this way:
  .iw-timeline  { --iw-timeline-line-color: white;
                  --iw-timeline-box-color:  #5b7bb4;
                  background-color:         #425b84;
                  color:                    white; }

Todo:
 - boxes with borders can look better, but arrows also should have it ...
 - to large whitespace between paragraph and the iw-timeline
