iw-tree                        - collapsible tree
  iw-tree__node--{inner|leaf}
  iw-tree__node--open          - the iw-tree__node--inner node of the tree that is open
    iw-tree__button            - "button" for expanding node of the tree
    iw-tree__title             - the <span> can be changed for example to <a> if needed

The 'iw-tree__node' BEM class isn't added to increase readability of a tree. It can be added later if needed.

iw-tree can be also navigated using keyboard:
 - press [shift+]tab or up/down arrow to focus another tree node,
 - press enter to expand/collapse the focused tree node.

todo:
 - optionally <span> tags can be replaced with <a> tags, buttons, checkboxes etc.
